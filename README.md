# Car-Sales-Analysis-Trends-Pricing-Insights

I worked on a Power BI dashboard to analyze automobile sales, pricing trends, and dealer performance using a dataset of nearly 500,000 vehicle transactions. This dashboard provides insights into:
✅ Total Cars Sold & Revenue 💰

✅ Market Deviation: Selling Price vs. Market Price (MMR) 📉

✅ State-Wise Sales Distribution & Pricing Trends 🌍

✅ Top Car Models & Popular Brands 🚗

✅ Transmission Type Preferences (Automatic vs. Manual) ⚙️

✅ Time-Series Analysis of Car Sales & Pricing Fluctuations ⏳

Key Findings:
📌 The average selling price of a vehicle is $8.67K, with a total revenue of $2 billion.

📌 The majority of vehicles sold have automatic transmission (~97% share).

📌 Sales are highest in specific regions based on demand trends.

📌 The average deviation between selling price and market price (MMR) is -673.90, indicating market inefficiencies.

💡 Why This Matters?

Understanding these insights helps dealerships, buyers, and market analysts make data-driven decisions on pricing, inventory, and demand forecasting.
